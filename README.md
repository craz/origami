origami
=======

Salesforce is the paper, and we are here to help you fold. Make your code a timeless art form by focusing on the tough problems. Origami is an ORM for Salesforce, abstracting the database connection one layer back to help make things easier, quicker and more effecient. Inspired by ORM's SQLAlchemy(Python), Django ORM/Models(Python) and ActiveRecord(Ruby/Rails). From the beginner, who can use this to learn how to interact with Salesforce in apex, to the experienced developer who can use this to code more effeciently, we have something for everyone.
